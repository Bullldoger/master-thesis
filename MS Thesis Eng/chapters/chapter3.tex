\chapter{Numerical results}

This chapter will focus on solving systems of differential equations, such as the Stokes equations and the linear elasticity problem. To assess the quality of the solution of the Stokes problem, a comparison will be made with analytically the velocity profile equation. An assessment of the solution of the linear elasticity problem will be carried out with the result of the obtained finite element method. The finite element solution was to build using free Fenics software. An analysis will be made of the quality of the solution regarding the architecture of neural networks, the number of parameters and activation functions.
